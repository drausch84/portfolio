                <p className = "about-me">My name is David Rausch, and I am a full-stack web developer.  Ever since I was a child, I always felt
                    that my mind would frequently wander(constantly daydreaming about a new painting I would want to create or a new book I would
                    want to start writing).  This creative spirit has led me to national writing workshops, a brief art career, as well as many other 
                    adventures.  It's also what led me to a love of code.  The marriage between logic and creativity instantly grabbed my attention when
                    I began to learn about coding independently(introducing myself to C++ and Java).  Independent learning wasn't enough and I enrolled
                    into Regis University in Denver, CO to obtain my BS degree in Computer Science and will tentatively graduate in the fall of 2019.  My desire
                    to learn more about the world of coding couldn't be contained to a college degree, however. I felt that the curriculum didn't focus much on 
                    programming, which is my primary interest.  So I attended and graduated with an A average from the University of Denver's Coding Boot Camp on 
                    July 12, 2018.  </p>

                    I grew up as a military brat and was enlisted in the USAF for an 8 year enlistment as well(primarily stationed on the East Coast).
                    I always dreamed of moving West and the Rocky Mountains are a big reason why.  During the summer, I rarely spend a weekend inside and am
                    constantly searching out new displays of beauty that only the outdoors of Colorado can provide:</p>
